<p>Latest McKinsey report <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-design/our-insights/redesigning-the-design-department">&quot;Redesigning the design department&quot;</a> was a joy to read and validated a lot of my thoughts about design departments. Couple of key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Designers should fully integrate into their project, product and service teams as peers rather than act as service providers. The design department is there to provide support, training and mentorship for the designer. The project team is there to provide purpose and possibilities. This cross-functional organization maximizes the surface area of design across the business and enables greatest impact. Centralized design department is a breeding ground for scaling, accountability and trust issues within the organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Old schoolish (e.g. non-agile) organizational structure doesn't mean that cross-functioning project, product and service teams are out of your reach. You can unlock design's potential without reorganizing the whole company. Don't look for excuses, just do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designers should also design the business, not just the products and services - and leadership should be calling that out to the business. As a designer, building the trust of business people from the bottom up takes too long and is risky. People move around and that trust gets reset too easily. That's why design needs a seat at the executive team - to get CEO, CFO, CHRO etc. on board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designers should do more than design - although I think this applies to every member of the organization. Understandment, integration and cross-functional expertise of the business and its functions is at the core of making better decisions and attracting and retaining talent. &quot;You have to have an equal position with the other functions before you've earned the right to challenge anyone.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feels nice to get some outside validation for our efforts. Let's just stay on track now.</p>
<p>&quot;We used to tell the designers what to do, now they're showing us what is possible — and it's so much better.&quot;</p>

Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.","The only way to do great work is to love what you do.","Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.","In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.","The unexamined life is not worth living.","It is not length of life, but depth of life.","To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.","The purpose of life is a life of purpose.","Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.","He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.","The mind is everything. What you think you become.","Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.","The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.","What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.","Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.","Turn your wounds into wisdom.","The only impossible journey is the one you never begin.","Not all those who wander are lost.","Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.","Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.","The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.","It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.","You must be the change you wish to see in the world.","The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.","Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.","Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.","What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.","Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.","The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.","Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.","An unexamined idea, to paraphrase Socrates, is not worth having.","The best way to predict the future is to create it.","We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.","The secret of getting ahead is getting started.","Every moment is a fresh beginning.","What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.","The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.","Creativity is intelligence having fun.","The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.","It always seems impossible until it's done.","Stay hungry, stay foolish.","Have no fear of perfection — you'll never reach it.","Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.","Less is more.","Good design is as little design as possible.","The details are not the details. They make the design.","If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design.","People ignore design that ignores people.","Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."];
