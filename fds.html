						<h2>About Fintraffic</h2>
						<p>
							Fintraffic controls and manages traffic on the land,
							in the air and at sea. It provides traffic
							information that helps companies to create new
							traffic and smart mobility solutions for people and
							goods.
						</p>
						<p>
							Intelligent traffic control and management services,
							up-to-date real-time traffic information and the
							competence of the company's 1,100 professionals
							improve the safety and smoothness of traffic and
							help reduce emissions. Fintraffic promotes
							sustainable traffic.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<h2>General information about the project</h2>
						<p>
							Fintraffic has a wide variety of public and internal
							digital services and software. Many of which are
							mission and safety critical traffic management tools
							that require formal training to use.
						</p>
						<p>
							Working for Fintraffic as a consultant, it became
							apparent very quickly that both the public services
							and internal tools lacked a cohesive and unified UX
							between themselves.
						</p>
						<p>
							I first pitched the idea of a company wide Design
							System for Fintraffic when I still worked as a
							consultant. Pitching the idea again after joining
							the ranks, I was happily surprised to find out the
							answer was a resounding yes. It supported
							Fintraffic's values and strategic goals perfectly.
						</p>
						<p>
							The development process the Design System MVP
							included, but was not limited to:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Procuring a team of designers to help make it
								happen
							</li>
							<li>
								Getting all of Fintraffic's different modes of
								transportation onboard (that was surprisingly
								easy)
							</li>
							<li>
								Inclusion of Fintraffic's development, product
								and service managers and many of our external
								designers and developers in the creation process
								in the form of workshops and surveys.
							</li>
							<li>
								Developing an airtight Design System Governance
								model
							</li>
							<li>
								Finding suitable pilot projects for the Design
								System MVP
							</li>
							<li>
								Developing a Figma library for the Design System
							</li>
							<li>
								Laying the ground work for the technical CSS
								framework and web component library
							</li>
							<li>
								Making all of this as public as possible to
								expose myself and the team to public scrutiny
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Fintraffic Design System helps to unify the customer
							and user experience in all of Fintraffic's public
							and internal digital services and tools with a
							common design language, UI guidelines and a
							component library. Over time it will drastically
							improve time-to-market (or time-to-production) by
							speeding up the development process of new and
							existing services and tools while reducing the
							development costs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Fintraffic Design System manifests itself publicly
							or semi-publicly in four different ways:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								a documentation site (<a
									href="https://design.fintraffic.fi"
									target="_blank"
									>design.fintraffic.fi</a
								>)
							</li>
							<li>a Figma library</li>
							<li>
								a CSS framework (WIP,
								<a
									href="https://github.com/fintraffic-design"
									target="_blank"
									>github.com/fintraffic-design</a
								>)
							</li>
							<li>
								a web component library (WIP,
								<a
									href="https://github.com/fintraffic-design"
									target="_blank"
									>github.com/fintraffic-design</a
								>)
							</li>
						</ul>
						<hr />
						<h2>My contribution</h2>
						<p>
							I'm the father of Fintraffic Design System and
							currently work as its design lead and product owner.
						</p>
						<p>
							I executed the procurement of the initial Design
							System team to help us with all the work involved in
							the process.
						</p>
						<p>
							During the MVP development process I oversaw the
							team's work, solved creative issues, prioritized
							backlog, defined the MVP features and participated
							in the hands on design work.
