						<h2>About Fintraffic</h2>
						<p>
							Fintraffic controls and manages traffic on the land,
							in the air and at sea. It provides traffic
							information that helps companies to create new
							traffic and smart mobility solutions for people and
							goods.
						</p>
						<p>
							Intelligent traffic control and management services,
							up-to-date real-time traffic information and the
							competence of the company's 1,100 professionals
							improve the safety and smoothness of traffic and
							help reduce emissions. Fintraffic promotes
							sustainable traffic.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<h2>General information</h2>
						<p>
							Railway traffic is a unique case amongst the modes
							of transportation. A single train can't move on
							tracks unless it has track capacity, schedule and
							traffic controller has given it a permission to move
							and made a safe route for it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Around 500 000 train journeys are completed in
							Finland every year. All of this traffic is managed
							and controlled 24/7 by Fintraffic Railway.
							Fintraffic currently employs around 300 railway
							traffic controllers.
						</p>
						<p>
							These 300 traffic controllers currently can use over
							a dozen of different digital tools in their shifts
							to manage this traffic. These tools are not very
							consistent in their user experience and traffic
							controllers often need to combine information from
							different systems manually.
						</p>
						<p>
							Railway Traffic Management is currently very
							reactionary and individual focused work, but
							Fintraffic is on a road to change that. Fintraffic
							Railway's strategy includes an objective to increase
							the grade of automation in railway traffic and
							provide more intelligent railway traffic services
							and solutions, which means ever increasing
							significance of the seamless integration and user
							experience between different systems and
							applications.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<h2>My contribution</h2>
						<p>
							In my role as a UX manager and UX lead I'm executing
							the company strategy and vision of a dynamic traffic
							management by unifying and creating a universal user
							experience across all of Finnish Railway Traffic
							Management Systems and Applications.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm responsible for managing and developing the user
							experience of almost 20 different mission and safety
							critical Railway Traffic Management Systems and
							Applications and I'm on a mission to build an
							integrated, modular Railway Traffic Management
							System UI for Finnish railways.
						</p>
						<p>
