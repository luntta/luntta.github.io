Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.","The only way to do great work is to love what you do.","Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.","In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.","The unexamined life is not worth living.","It is not length of life, but depth of life.","To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.","The purpose of life is a life of purpose.","Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.","He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.","The mind is everything. What you think you become.","Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.","The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.","What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.","Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.","Turn your wounds into wisdom.","The only impossible journey is the one you never begin.","Not all those who wander are lost.","Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.","Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.","The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.","It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.","You must be the change you wish to see in the world.","The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.","Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.","Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.","What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.","Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.","The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.","Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.","An unexamined idea, to paraphrase Socrates, is not worth having.","The best way to predict the future is to create it.","We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.","The secret of getting ahead is getting started.","Every moment is a fresh beginning.","What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.","The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.","Creativity is intelligence having fun.","The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.","It always seems impossible until it's done.","Stay hungry, stay foolish.","Have no fear of perfection — you'll never reach it.","Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.","Less is more.","Good design is as little design as possible.","The details are not the details. They make the design.","If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design.","People ignore design that ignores people.","Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."];
