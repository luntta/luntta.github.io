						<h2>General information</h2>
						<p>
							KUPLA (Kuljettajan päätelaite) is a mission & safety
							critical train driver's tablet application that
							every train driver must use before and during their
							scheduled driving missions. It enables electronic
							communication between the train driver and traffic
							control. It entered production use in 2016.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is used in varying difficult and challenging
							environments where bad usability and user experience
							could in worst case lead to a fatal disaster. Driver
							needs to be able to receive and process information
							in any given situation without delay.
						</p>
						<p>
							KUPLA delivers critical information the driver needs
							to carry out their driving mission. This information
							can be available before the driving mission or
							arrive during it. This includes information such as:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>All the commercial stops the train has</li>
							<li>
								Any temporary speed restrictions on the route
								and where they are
							</li>
							<li>Other restrictions during the journey</li>
						</ul>
						<hr />
						<h2>My contribution</h2>
						<p>
							I worked as a lead designer in the project and
							helped design and implement some of the users' most
							wanted features in to the app.
						</p>
						<p>
							I worked as part of KUPLA's agile development team
							and worked closely with KUPLA users and other
							stakeholders to deliver well-thought-out features
							that went through rigorous change and risk
							assessment and management processes.
						</p>
						<p>
							I succeeded in my drive to modernize the UI and UX
							of the core features of the app and I'm still
							overseeing that work being done.
						</p>
